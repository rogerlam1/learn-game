# Testing Your Tetris Game

Now that we've created the game code, let's try it out!

## How to Play

1. Look at your web browser. The game should be visible at http://localhost:3000/

2. If you don't see the game, make sure your terminal is still running `npm run dev`

3. Try using the keyboard controls:
   - Left Arrow: Move block left
   - Right Arrow: Move block right
   - Down Arrow: Move block down faster
   - Up Arrow: Rotate block

4. Try to complete lines to score points!

5. Play the game for a few minutes and see if everything works correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:
- Check that all the code was added correctly
- Make sure you didn't close the terminal window running the game
- Try refreshing the browser
