# Saving Your Tetris Game

Great job building and testing your game! Now let's save your work using Git.

## What is Git?

Git is a tool that helps programmers save their work. Think of it like taking a snapshot of your code so you can come back to it later.

## Saving Your Work

1. Click on the Terminal at the bottom of the screen (same place where you ran `npm run dev`)

2. Type these commands one at a time, pressing Enter after each one:

```
git checkout -b my-tetris-game
```
This creates a new branch (a separate workspace) for your game.

```
git add .
```
This tells Git to track all the changes you've made.

```
git commit -m "Created my Tetris game"
```
This saves your changes with a message describing what you did.

## Next Step

Now that you've saved your work, go to the next step: open the file `Tutorial/Step5-ShareTetris.md`
