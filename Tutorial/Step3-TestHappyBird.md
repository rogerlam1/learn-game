# Testing Your Happy Bird Game

Now that we've created the game code, let's try it out!

## How to Play

1. Look at your web browser. The game should be visible at http://localhost:3000/

2. If you don't see the game, make sure your terminal is still running `npm run dev`

3. Try using the keyboard controls:
   - Space Bar: Make the bird fly upward
   - Try to time your jumps carefully to fly through the obstacles!

4. Try to get through as many obstacles as possible to score points!

5. Play the game for a few minutes and see if everything works correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If something doesn't work:
- Check that all the code was added correctly
- Make sure you didn't close the terminal window running the game
- Try refreshing the browser

## Next Step
