# Building Your Tetris Game

Congratulations on choosing to build Tetris! This is a fun game where you control falling blocks and try to complete rows.

## What You'll Need

You'll use Cursor to modify the code. Cursor is a special text editor that can help you write code with AI (that's me)!

## Let's Make the Game!

1. First, look at the code in the left side panel. This is where your game will be built.

2. Type this prompt in the chat box (where you're talking to me now):

```
Create a simple Tetris game with keyboard controls. Use React to:
1. Make a grid for the Tetris pieces
2. Create different block shapes (using simple colored squares)
3. Make blocks fall automatically
4. Let me use arrow keys to move left, right, and down
5. Let me use the up arrow to rotate pieces
6. Add a score that increases when lines are completed
7. End the game when blocks reach the top
```

3. After you enter this prompt, I'll help you make the game!

4. Once the code is created, go to the next step: open the file `Tutorial/Step3-TestTetris.md`
